# AdventOfCode2024

My Advent of Code 2024 workspace.


### AdventTemplate

I created the 'dotnet new advent' template to quickly stand up a project for each day
of the event. Over the course of the event, the template may (will) be
updated to include any helpers or references. To make it easier to install/uninstall, I added these PowerShell
scripts.

```powershell
.\install-template.ps1

.\uninstall-template.ps1

```

To add a new day to the solution, run the this script giving the day number as
a parameter.

```powershell

.\add-daynumber.ps1 03

```



**Happy Coding**
