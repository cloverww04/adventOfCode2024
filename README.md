# adventOfCode2024
I'm using a template created by [@danielwcarey](https://github.com/danielwcarey). If you switch to the adventOfCode2024 branch that's where I make changes to the Star1 and Star2.cs based on the task of the day. In the adventOfCode2024 readme is where you'll find Daniel's instructions on how to use the template.
